I love to code in Python
I made 2 telegram bots using python and replit
I made an algebra solver
I made a basic unimpressive blackhole simulator
I am learning JS (Starting on 6/6 when IGCSE leaves me alone)
And Imma show you my talent, and you gonna get jealous just like how i did with your code that I s̶t̶o̶l̶e burrowed from you.
